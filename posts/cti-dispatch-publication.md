## The Writing Process

Creating each edition involves:

```python
# Example: Threat Intelligence Workflow
def create_weekly_edition():
    # 1. Source Collection
    sources = [
        "Security vendor reports",
        "Government advisories", 
        "Open source intelligence",
        "Dark web monitoring",
        "Industry threat feeds"
    ]
    
    # 2. Content Curation
    curated_content = filter_relevant_threats(sources)
    
    # 3. Analysis and Context
    analyzed_content = add_strategic_context(curated_content)
    
    # 4. Executive Summary
    summary = create_executive_summary(analyzed_content)
    
    # 5. Publication
    publish_edition(summary, analyzed_content)
