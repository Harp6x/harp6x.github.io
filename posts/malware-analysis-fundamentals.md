# Malware Analysis Fundamentals: From Static to Dynamic

*Published on January 10, 2024*

## Introduction

Malware analysis is a critical skill in cybersecurity that involves examining malicious software to understand its behavior, capabilities, and potential impact. This guide covers the fundamental approaches to malware analysis.

## Analysis Types

### Static Analysis

Static analysis examines malware without executing it:

- **File structure analysis**
- **String extraction**
- **Import/Export analysis**
- **Code disassembly**
- **YARA rule creation**

### Dynamic Analysis

Dynamic analysis involves running malware in controlled environments:

- **Behavioral monitoring**
- **Network traffic analysis**
- **System call monitoring**
- **Memory analysis**
- **Registry monitoring**

## Tools of the Trade

### Static Analysis Tools

```bash
# PE file analysis
strings malware.exe
file malware.exe
peid malware.exe

# Disassembly
objdump -d malware.exe
radare2 malware.exe
```

### Dynamic Analysis Tools

- **Cuckoo Sandbox**: Automated malware analysis
- **Process Monitor**: System call monitoring
- **Wireshark**: Network traffic analysis
- **Volatility**: Memory forensics
- **Process Hacker**: Process monitoring

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Initial Assessment

```python
import pefile

pe = pefile.PE('malware.exe')
print(f"Architecture: {pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.Magic}")
print(f"Entry Point: {pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.AddressOfEntryPoint}")
print(f"Subsystem: {pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.Subsystem}")
```

### 2. String Analysis

Extract and analyze strings for:
- URLs and IP addresses
- File paths
- Registry keys
- API calls
- Encryption keys

### 3. Import Analysis

Identify imported functions:
- Network communication APIs
- File system operations
- Registry manipulation
- Process creation
- Anti-debugging techniques

### 4. Behavioral Analysis

Monitor for:
- File system changes
- Registry modifications
- Network connections
- Process creation
- Service installation

## Common Malware Families

### Ransomware
- File encryption
- Ransom notes
- Network propagation
- Anti-recovery mechanisms

### Trojans
- Backdoor functionality
- Data exfiltration
- Keylogging capabilities
- Remote control features

### Rootkits
- System-level persistence
- Anti-detection mechanisms
- Kernel-level modifications
- Boot sector infection

## Analysis Environment Setup

### Virtual Machine Configuration

```bash
# Snapshot management
VBoxManage snapshot "MalwareVM" take "CleanState"
VBoxManage snapshot "MalwareVM" restore "CleanState"

# Network isolation
VBoxManage modifyvm "MalwareVM" --nic1 hostonly
```

### Monitoring Tools

- **Process Monitor**: Real-time system monitoring
- **API Monitor**: API call interception
- **Regshot**: Registry change detection
- **Wireshark**: Network traffic capture

## YARA Rules

Create custom detection rules:

```yara
rule Malware_Family_Example {
    meta:
        description = "Detects specific malware family"
        author = "Uddip Ranjan Das"
        date = "2024-01-10"
    
    strings:
        $s1 = "malicious_string_1"
        $s2 = "malicious_string_2"
        $s3 = "malicious_string_3"
    
    condition:
        2 of them
}
```

## Reporting

### Analysis Report Structure

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Malware type and family
   - Impact assessment
   - Key findings

2. **Technical Details**
   - File characteristics
   - Behavioral analysis
   - Network indicators
   - Persistence mechanisms

3. **IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)**
   - File hashes
   - IP addresses
   - Domain names
   - Registry keys

4. **Mitigation Strategies**
   - Detection rules
   - Prevention measures
   - Response procedures

## Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Always analyze malware in isolated environments
2. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed analysis notes
3. **Automation**: Use automated tools for repetitive tasks
4. **Collaboration**: Share findings with the security community
5. **Continuous Learning**: Stay updated with new malware techniques

## Conclusion

Malware analysis is both an art and a science. Success requires technical expertise, analytical thinking, and continuous learning. The key is to understand not just what malware does, but why it does it and how to prevent similar attacks.
